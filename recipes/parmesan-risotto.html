    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I created this truffle risotto recipe because there's nothing quite like creamy, savory rice. It's so delicious and filling, it's almost a meal in itself! You do need to tend to the stove for 30 minutes for stirring, but it's definitely worth the effort. I used regular milk (not cream) and it was absolutely heavenly and creamy! Serve as soon as possible; otherwise, it can get very pasty.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>1/4 chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 medium oninon, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup hot water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup grtated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white truffle oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat chicken broth in a stockpot over medium-low heat until warmed, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan until butter melts. Add onion and saut√© until translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in rice until coated, then cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour wine into rice mixture; cook and stir until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Add one ladle hot broth and cook, stirring constantly, until broth is absorbed. Continue adding and stirring in one ladle broth at a time until rice is tender but firm to the bite, 20 to 30 minutes. If you run out of broth before rice is cooked, finish cooking with hot water. </li>
        <li>Stir in Parmesan, remaining 2 tablespoons butter, truffle oil, and milk until fully incorporated, then season with parsley, salt, and pepper. Serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
